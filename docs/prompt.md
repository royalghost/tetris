The following prompt was given for the the first iteration of the project:


Can you help me develop a basic Tetris game in html, css and javascript ?

Here are the basic rules :
The basic rules of Tetris are:

1. Playing field: The game takes place on a rectangular grid, typically 10 cells wide by 20 cells high.

2. Tetrominos: Seven different shapes, each made of four squares, fall from the top of the screen.

3. Movement: Players can:
   - Move pieces left or right
   - Rotate pieces clockwise or counterclockwise
   - Accelerate the piece's fall ("soft drop")
   - Instantly drop the piece to the bottom ("hard drop")

4. Placing pieces: Tetrominos stack on top of each other and the bottom of the playing field.

5. Line clearing: When a horizontal line of blocks is completely filled, it disappears, and all blocks above it fall down.

6. Scoring: Players score points for clearing lines. Clearing multiple lines at once (up to four) yields more points.

7. Levels: The game speed increases as the player clears more lines or as time passes.

8. Game over: The game ends when new Tetrominos can't enter the playing field because it's too full.

9. Goal: The objective is to score as many points as possible before the game ends.

These are the fundamental rules, though some versions may have additional features or slight variations. Would you like more information on any specific aspect of gameplay?
